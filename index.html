        <!--Put in a particular experience that hooked me on-->
        <p class="my-name">I am a recent graduate of Nanyang Polytechnic with a diploma in Applied Chemistry. It was one particular experience in the laboratory which sparked my interest in chemistry. This experience was not any particular experiment in the syllabus, rather it was a competition that my teacher had set up. We were tasked to mix aqueous sodium hydroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid until the added pH universal indicator had turned green, indicating neutrality. The only catch was that we were only allowed to use one test tube full of chemicals. It was through this that I had been fascinated by how much one drop of chemical could alter the entire outcome of the solution or in the future, the results of an entire experiment. From then, I knew that this subject was something I wanted to dive deeper into and explore.</p>
        <p class="my-name">Some of my past times include crocheting and doing volunteer work. Crocheting has helped me in developing the need for precision and accuracy for all my work which has helped me consistently obtain accurate and reliable results in all my experiments. My passion and dedication to giving back to society has led me to develop the habit of participating in at least 2 volunteer projects in my church every year. I would also occasionally sign up for projects that I stumble across on the internet during my holidays.</p>
        <p class="my-name">One hobby of mine that I always make time for would be research on the latest scientific advancements in chemistry and how they are affecting the world. I find articles about what big corporations are doing in terms of chemical advancements fascinating and reading up on all these all aid in my understanding of my school work during my lectures. It is like killing two birds with one stone!</p>
        <p class="my-name">These are just some of the many interesting things about me. Do explore my digital portfolio to find out more about my achievements, projects and experiences!</p>

        <p>"Giselle was a very detailed-orientated and passionate person to work with. During my job attachment with her, she was constantly staying up late at home to try and perfect our experiment so that we could obtain the best results. She was also always the quickest to point out errors when our data had inconsistentcy in them."</p>

        <p>"Giselle was a very good team leader when it came to leading our group in experiments. In class, she would assign us different roles to do such that we were always able to complete our experiments quickly. She would also ensure to check our work and was quick to point out any erros and offer to teach how to correct it. Our group always obtained accurate results that even our teachers were impressed!"</p>
