          <p>During my holidays, I accomplished a work attachment at NUS. I was assigned to work at an analytical lab with a few other students from other schools. During my work term there, I completed a project about reducing nitrate levels in water using copper, nickel and carbon fiber paper electrodes via electrochemical reduction alongside my fellow peers. While working on our research, we were held accountable for our workspace and had to ensure cleanliness and tidiness of the laboratory at the end of the day before we went home. We ensured that our equipment were calibrated properly before and after usage as well as made sure that they were properly cleaned after every use. This experience allowed me further strengthen my teamwork and communication skills as well as develop my project management skills which has helped me better manage my school projects.</p>

            <h1>Internship</h1>
            <h2>September 2024 - January</h2>
            <p>I completed a 24-week long internship at Monash College Melbourne, Australia as per my academic syllabus. Staying abroad alone for the first time, I had learnt how to become more independent and take charge of my own life. Without having my parents there, I had to learn how to properly manage my time between work and outside affairs. My time there also allowed me to become more adaptable as I adapted to sudden changes in environment and work practices. During my work term there, I was assigned to shadow one of the laboratory technicians. One of my tasks included assisting in method validation to ensure that the experiment was safe and that the procedure steps allowed the experiment to be repeated by the students. As the lesson curriculum had a vast variety of topics, I was able to practise using equipment which I was not able to use regularly back in school such as high performance liquid chromatography. If the experimental procedures had errors in them, I was also to propose changes to the steps and present them to my supervisor. Overall, my entire experience during this internship was very eye-opening and it allowed me to broaden my knowledge about the field of chemistry.</p>
